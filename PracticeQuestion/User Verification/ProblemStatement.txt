public User ValidatePhoneNumber(String name, String phoneNumber)	This method should check whether the length of the phoneNumber is equal to 10, if phoneNumber length is equal to 10 then copy the name and phoneNumber to the User object and return it.
If the phoneNumber length is not equal to 10, then throw a user-defined exception called InvalidPhoneNumberException with the message "Invalid phone number".
